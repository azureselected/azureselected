# Getting Started With AzureML Notebook VMs

<ContentMeta />

(Notice this post is out of date please check out [Azure Machine Learning Compute Instance’s](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-instance/?WT.mc_id=blog-medium-abornst) a new post describing how to get started is coming soon!)

TLDR; [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml?WT.mc_id=blog-medium-abornst) (AML), a cloud-based environment you can use to train, deploy, automate, manage, and track ML models. In the following tutorial we will walk through how to set up an Azure Notebook VM.

## What are the benefits of AzureML Notebook VMs?

Azure ML Notebook VMs are cloud-based environments preloaded with everything you need to get started with ML and data science in Azure.

AML Notebook VMs are secure and easy-to-use, fully customizable and directly integrated into Azure Machine Learning Service, providing a code-first experience for data scientists to build and deploy models using AzureML

Azure ML Notebook VM Features:

- **Secure** — Azure Active Directory login integrated with the AML Workspace, provides access to files stored in the workspace, implicitly configured for the workspace.
- **Scalable**— created with a few clicks in the AML workspace portal, managed from within the AML workspace portal. Since notebooks are managed by the AML Service compute can be scaled as needed.
- **Pre-Configured**— up-to-date AML Python Environment, GPU drivers, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Scikit learn, R etc.
- **Customizable** — ssh to the machine, install your own tools (or drivers), changes persist when machines are shut down or restarted.

## Step 1: Login to Azure

If you don’t have an Azure Subscription you can get a free account using the link below.

[Create your Azure free account today](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?WT.mc_id=blog-medium-abornst).

## Step 2: Create Azure Machine Learning Workspace

Follow the instructions in the gif above to create a new azure machine learning service instance. More information can be found below.

## Step 3: Navigate to Azure ML Compute

## Step 4: Click New Compute

## Step 5: Choose the VM Size and Deploy

A list of VM Sizes and pricing can be found in the documentation below. The standard series is recommended for most projects and the N series are recommended for projects requiring GPU.

When you are done click create it should take about 5–10 mins to set up the new VM depending on the specified configuration.

## Step 6: Jupyter, JupyterLab or Open R Studio and Get Started Coding

## Bonus Best Practice: Shutdown VM when not in use delete VM when using standard dependencies.

Since all notebooks are persisted in the notebooks section of the Azure ML Service unlike a DSVM your work can be recovered and shared across multiple notebook VMs. So it is seamless to start with a standard VM for basic data processing and later switch to a N Series VM if GPU Compute is needed.
